Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n\nJust like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n\n## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

Imagine a team of intelligent, independent \"workers\" collaborating seamlessly to get the job done. That's the promise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), and it's a game-changer for modern software development.\n\nAt its core, a MAS is a collection of autonomous agents, each with its own decision-making capabilities. These agents communicate, negotiate, and coordinate their actions to achieve a shared goal or solve a complex problem. Unlike traditional monolithic systems, MAS excel in their decentralized intelligence and emergent behavior, allowing for remarkable adaptability.\n\nFor developers, the advantages are significant. MAS offers unparalleled efficiency and scalability. Large tasks can be broken down and processed concurrently by different agents, dramatically speeding up development cycles. Need to handle a surge in demand? Simply add more agents – scaling becomes a dynamic and less disruptive process. Furthermore, resources are utilized more effectively as agents are allocated to tasks based on availability and needs.\n\nTackling complexity becomes much more manageable. MAS naturally promotes modular design, with each agent encapsulating a specific function or domain. This simplifies debugging and maintenance, allowing you to isolate issues within individual agents rather than navigating a vast codebase. Crucially, MAS are adept at handling dynamic and uncertain environments, as agents can adapt their behavior in real-time.\n\nUltimately, adopting MAS leads to smarter, more resilient software. The decentralized nature enhances fault tolerance; if one agent falters, others can often compensate. The interactions between agents can even lead to emergent intelligence and optimized solutions you might not have initially conceived. By embracing MAS, you're future-proofing your applications for an increasingly complex digital world. It's time to unlock this powerful paradigm and build the next generation of software.\nEditorAgent > ## Supercharge Your Software: Unlocking the Power of Multi-Agent Systems\n\nAre your software projects struggling under the weight of numerous tasks, leading to tangled complexity and looming deadlines? Picture this: a team of intelligent, independent \"workers\" collaborating seamlessly to achieve a common objective. This is the compelling vision of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), a paradigm poised to revolutionize modern software development.\n\nAt its heart, a MAS comprises a collection of autonomous agents, each endowed with its own decision-making prowess. These agents engage in communication, negotiation, and coordinated actions to accomplish a shared goal or unravel intricate problems. What sets MAS apart from conventional monolithic systems is their decentralized intelligence and capacity for emergent behavior, which fosters remarkable adaptability.\n\nFor software developers, the benefits are substantial. MAS unlocks unparalleled efficiency and scalability. Complex tasks can be deconstructed into smaller, parallelizable units, allowing different agents to tackle them concurrently. This not only accelerates development cycles but also simplifies scaling. Facing a sudden spike in demand? Simply introduce more agents – scaling becomes a fluid and less disruptive undertaking. Moreover, resource utilization is optimized as agents are intelligently allocated to tasks based on real-time availability and necessity.\n\nComplexity, often a daunting challenge, becomes far more manageable with MAS. This approach inherently promotes modular design, with each agent encapsulating a distinct function or domain. This modularity streamlines debugging and maintenance, enabling developers to pinpoint and resolve issues within isolated agents rather than navigating an expansive and convoluted codebase. Crucially, MAS are exceptionally well-suited for dynamic and uncertain environments, as agents can dynamically adjust their behavior in response to changing conditions.\n\nUltimately, embracing MAS results in the creation of smarter, more resilient software. The decentralized architecture enhances fault tolerance; if one agent encounters an issue, others can often step in to maintain system functionality. The intricate interactions between agents can even give rise to emergent intelligence and optimized solutions that might not have been foreseen during the initial design phase. By adopting MAS, you are future-proofing your applications for an increasingly interconnected and complex digital landscape. It's time to harness the potential of this powerful paradigm and usher in the next generation of software.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"👏 Great job!

You've seen how parallel agents can dramatically speed up workflows by running independent tasks concurrently.\n\nSo far, all our workflows run from start to finish and then stop. **But what if you need to review and improve an output multiple times?** Next, we'll build a workflow that can loop and refine its own work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## ➰ Section 5: Loop Workflows - The Refinement Cycle\n\n**The Problem: One-Shot Quality**\n\nAll the workflows we've seen so far run from start to finish. The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=Gemini(\n        model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n        retry_options=retry_config\n    ),\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\",  # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-11T16:23:20.795145Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-11T16:23:20.795447Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-11T16:23:20.801340Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-11T16:23:20.795431Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-11T16:23:20.800367Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.
